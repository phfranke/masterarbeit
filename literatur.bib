abstract = {Native plants and animals can rapidly become superabundant and dominate ecosystems, leading to claims that native species are no less likely than alien species to cause environmental damage, including biodiversity loss. We compared how frequently alien and native species have been implicated as drivers of recent extinctions in a comprehensive global database, the 2017 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Alien species were considered to be a contributing cause of 25\% of plant extinctions and 33\% of animal extinctions, whereas native species were implicated in less than 5\% and 3\% of plant and animal extinctions, respectively. When listed as a putative driver of recent extinctions, native species were more often associated with other extinction drivers than were alien species. Our results offer additional evidence that the biogeographic origin, and hence evolutionary history, of a species are determining factors of its potential to cause disruptive environmental impacts.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of spatially structured populations (SSP) is a critical challenge for ecologists and conservation managers. Internal population processes such as births and deaths occur at a local level, while external processes such as dispersal take place at an inter-population level. At both levels, density dependence is expected to play a critical role. At a patch scale, demographic traits (e.g., survival, breeding success) and the population growth rate can be influenced by density either negatively (e.g., competition effect) or positively (e.g., Allee effects). At the scale of an SSP, although positive density-dependent dispersal has been widely reported, an increasing number of studies have highlighted negative density-dependent dispersal. While many studies have investigated the effects of density on population growth or on dispersal, few have simultaneously examined density-dependent effects at the scale of both the local population and the entire SSP. In this study, we examine how density is related to demographic processes at both the pond level (survival and population growth) and the SSP level (between-pond dispersal) in a pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). The study was based on 20 years of individual capture–recapture (CR) data (from 1996 to 2015) gathered from an SSP made up of 12 experimental ponds (“patches”). We first used a CR multievent model to estimate both survival and dispersal rates in specific ponds as a function of distance between ponds. Then, using a second CR multievent model, we examined whether survival and recapture rates were influenced by population density in a pond. Lastly, we used state-space time series models to investigate whether density affected population growth in each pond. Our results found a positive density-dependent effect on survival and a negative density-dependent effect on departure. In addition, the findings indicate that population growth was negatively related to density in all 12 ponds. These results support the hypothesis that in SSPs, density may have multiple and contrasting effects on demographic parameters and growth rates within local populations as well as on dispersal. This study underlines the need to better understand how density dependence may influence potential trade-offs between life-history strategies and life-history stages.},

 abstract = {Three surveys in the Basin of Geneva (Switzerland and adjacent France) reveal a decline of crested newts, from 22 known populations in 1975, to 11 in 1987, and to seven in 1997. Using morphological and genetic markers, 16 out of 18 populations are identified as (allochthonous) T. carnifex or mixed populations of T. carnifex-T. cristatus. Syntopic populations are characterized by the incomplete mixing of genotypes. The presence of the genes of T. cristatus in T. carnifex demonstrates past hybridization events. Two populations are identified as (autochthonous) T. cristatus; its presence is now restricted to the northeastern fringe of the Basin. Identification of preserved material indicates that the introduction of T. carnifex took place early this century. The data imply that over 30-40 generations, T. carnifex has established itself in the Basin of Geneva at the expense of T. cristatus. No significant change in the relative distribution of the two species was observed from 1987-1997, and we conclude that the recent spread of T. carnifex has been nonexistent or slow.},
