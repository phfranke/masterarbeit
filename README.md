Agent based modelling of a population of italian crested newts (Triturus carnifex) in north-west Switzerland.
The newts are treated as foreign species, which endangers a local population of the red-list species northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus).
There are taken measures to erase the italian newts for protection reasons.
This model investigates the impact of this measures.

A copy of the gama-model is here: ./gama_modelle

To run the model on your own machine, copy the latest version into your Gama- directory.
